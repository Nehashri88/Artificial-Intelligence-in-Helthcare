### 5.	Challenges and Possible Solutions
Healthcare is a complex field that is confined by legal, ethical, regulatory, economic, and social factors, there are several challenges that AI tools must face to provide reasonable results. 

Some of the challenges and possible solutions for these risks are listed below;

#### 5.1.	Ethical Challenges
##### Data Security and credibility
* AI algorithm required a lot of data. Data is collected from various sources such as patient records, pharmacy records, insurance claim records, clinical data, electronic health records, consumer-generated information like fitness trackers, or purchasing history Most often data are fragmented and incomplete. This increases the risk of a discrepancy, reduces the comprehensiveness of datasets, and increases the cost of data analysis which is required for research purposes.

* The strengthening of regulations and laws relating to personal data are potential answers to this problem.

##### Privacy and Transparency
* Confidentiality is the key element in the medical industry. Some latest public alliances for AI implementation have resulted in inadequate privacy protection. To protect patient privacy and independence, appropriate safeguards must be in place. Competing goals can have an impact on private data custodians, so they should be structurally encouraged to ensure data security.
* Ethical issues need to be considered before ambient intelligence systems are added to the healthcare system. Privacy is a crucial concern, but privacy considerations must be balanced with other interests and values. Interdisciplinary collaboration will be valuable in identifying and addressing potential ethical issues.
##### Bias: 
* There can be unintended bias in the algorithm since AI decision is solely based on the input data, the information it receives must have an exact depiction of patient demographics. Many patients do not have a clear understanding of how algorithms are created and calibrated. Any bias that exists in a dataset will affect the performance of the machine learning system. There are many sources, including population, frequency, and instrumentation bias.
* Bias may be addressed within AI models as well, such as a recent bias-resilient neural network that minimizes the relevance of several influencing factors.

#### 5.2.	Legal challenges
* Algorithmic transparency, cybersecurity vulnerabilities, unfairness, bias, and discrimination, lack of contestability, legal personhood issues, intellectual property issues, negative effects on workers, privacy and data protection issues, damage liability, and lack of accountability are all issues that need to be addressed.




### 6.	Conclusion
AI may be beneficial in health care services in the long term, but it will require stringent guidelines, similar to that which governs physician conduct. 
With so many problems to fix, including well-documented issues like elderly relative chronic disease rates, the need for more innovative healthcare solutions is evident.
Despite the significant media attention, AI-powered solutions have only taken tiny efforts toward tackling important concerns and have yet to make a meaningful overall impact on the global healthcare industry. 

If many critical hurdles can be overcome in the coming years, it has the potential to play a key role in how future healthcare systems run, supplementing clinical resources and assuring the best possible patient outcomes.
